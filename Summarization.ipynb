    "#text = '''In an interview to India Today, legendary all-rounder Kapil Dev had said the West Indies had more Champagne at the mid-innings break of the 1983 World Cup final than India. Kapil's men had posted a below-par total of 183 in the big final on June 25, 1983 at the Lord's, London.\n",
    "#It seemed India's fairytale run in the World Cup would come to an end. The West Indies were set for a third straight title. Clive Llyod's side had superstars who, on their day, could just blow away the challenge of chasing 184. But June 25, 1983 wasn't their day. It was the day that arguably changed Indian cricket forever.\n",
    "#Gordon Greenidge fails. Sir Vivian Richards walks in with the swagger that is known for. The gum-chewing slayer gets on with his innings and hits a flurry of boundaries.\n",
    "#Madan Lal is under the pump but he isn't willing to go away. He goes to skipper Kapil Dev and asks for the ball. Lal cramps Richards for room but the batting great tries to pull one into the stands. Instead, the ball balloons up and Kapil Dev takes a breathtaking catch to send the West Indies star walking back to the hut.\n",
    "#Once Vivian Richards was dismissed, Indians had their tails up. Clive Lloyd fell to Roger Binny without troubling the scorers much. Jeff Dujon and Malcolm Marshall tried to revive the chase with a 43-run stand for the 7th wicket but Mohinder Amarnath stepped into action and removed both of them in quick succession.\n",
    "#Amarnath dealt the final blow and sealed India's historic win by trapping Michael Holding in front. West Indies were bowled out for 140. Their World Cup-winning streak was broken. Cricket had its new world champions!'''"
